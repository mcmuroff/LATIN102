**C. Literary Commentary**
1. Diction: I found it interesting that Hyginus chose to omit the subject from the verb *adduxit.* This allows for better flow in the passage, 
insofar as Hyginus does not need to repeat the subject. 
2. Diction: I also found it interesting that Hyginus chose to have two direct objects in the first sentence; namely, *stercus bobile.* 
This enhances the sentence by providing imagery (not just dung, but *stall* dung), and it contrasts nicely with the verb *purgavit*, or "cleaned."


**Translation**
He cleaned the stall dung of King Augeas in one day, the greater part with the helper Juppiter.
All the dung washes away having been led in the river. ❌ **Go back to your grammatical questions:  *stercus* is a direct object, no subject.**
**When the river had been led in, he washed all the dung away**  
He prompted the alive bull to Mycenae from the island Crete with which Pasiphae had sexual intercourse with.
He killed King Diomedes of Thraciae and the four horses of him, which were feeding upon human flesh, with the servant Abderum; 
moreover, the names of the four horses were Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus.
