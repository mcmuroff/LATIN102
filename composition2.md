1. Your composition should use at least two participles and two relative clauses.
2. Your composition should include at least one expression of purpose using ad + a noun or pronoun modified by a gerundive.
3. our first sentence should use a negative purpose clause to say that when Deianira, the daughter of Oeneus and the wife of Hercules saw that the beautiful young girl Iole had been brought (to her house), she began to devise a plot in order not to lose her husband (or “be deprived of” her husband).
4. Your second sentence should express that she sent her servant to bring to Hercules a garment dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus, which she thought was a love potion.
5. Your third sentence should say that Hercules put the garment on and it immediately burst into flames.
6. Your fourth sentence should express that Hercules threw the slave, whom Deianira had sent to bring the garment back, into the sea.

Cum Deianira, filia Oenei et uxor Herculis, vidit Iole, iuvenem et pulchram, adduco domum, ea machinatam sum ut ne privavi eam virum. Deianira famulum misit ad ferendam vestem tinctam in sanguine centauri Nessi Herculi, quem ea putavit esse philtrum. Hercules induit vestem, et statim flammavit. Hercules, lusus pro Nessum, iecit famulum, quem Deianira redisse vestum missus est, in mare. Hercules fuit deum, sed Deianira interfecit se ne factum ferret.
