**A. Commentary**

I. Passage - Chapter 30, Section 1:

Infans cum esset, dracones duos duabus manibus necauit, quos Iuno miserat, unde primigenius est dictus.

- I believe Hyginus' use of the word "two" really enhances Hercules' strength in this passage. The repetitive nature of Hercules killing the **two** dragons with his **two** hands puts emphasis on Hercules and the impressive way in which he killed the dragons. 
- I found Hyginus' use of the word *unde* or "whence" to be particularly striking because it rather dramatically emphasizes Hercules being "the first born." The word "whence" is a partcularly powerful word in English rhetoric. President John F. Kennedy once famously said in a speech "And when we go back to the sea whether it is to sail or to watch it - we are going back from whence we came." It's likely that President Kennedy took his inspiration from Classical literature and perhaps even Hyginus himself.
