**A. Commentary**

I. Passage - Chapter 30, Section 1:

Infans cum esset, dracones duos duabus manibus necauit, quos Iuno miserat, unde primigenius est dictus.

- I believe Hyginus' use of the word "two" really enhanced Hercules' strength. The repetitive nature of Hercules killing the **two** dragons with his **two** hands puts emphasis on Hercules and the impressive way in which he killed the dragons.
